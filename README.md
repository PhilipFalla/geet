# Geet
Geet is an educational git alternative, developed to understand git's internals.

### Installation
To be able to run the *geet* command in your terminal, you need to create an alias in your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file (example with **zsh** provided).

#### Zsh
In your `.zshrc` file add the following line and save the changes:  

> `alias geet='python3 /Users/tortolala/Repositories/geet/geet/main.py'`

After restarting your terminal, you should be able to execute:  

> `geet`    

...and voilÃ .
